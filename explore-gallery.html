      <h2>The Returning of My Soul</h2>
      <p>Dear Margit Tennosaar,<br>
        <br>
        I understand that I have no chance of being forgiven for not submitting my project on time, 
        however, I would like to kindly ask you to read this to the end.<br>
        <br> 
        First of all, it was you who inspired me to create the Project which you can observe now, 
        I know that I have slightly changed the rules of the assignment, but I have an explanation for it.  
        At the very moment, when you assessed my, in my strong opinion – very nice looking and cozy, white 
        shadows on the web page buttons, as quote – “old fashioned weird effect from 90’s”, I decided to prove 
        you but especially to myself that I know “a little bit” about design principles. Therefore, please, 
        take a sit and read the Story…<br>
        <br>
        Long time ago, before the Age of Humans, time when Andromeda Galaxy was not even was visible in the 
        night sky, one brave man decided to set out on a journey to the ancient, unspoiled land, the land with the 
        name – The Kingdom of CSS. To step on a path through treacherous realms swarming with monsters called Bugs, 
        hazardous surfaces or else knows as Bad animations and other dangers, not the least of which is an encounter 
        with the Source. No one knows what it is, but everyone is afraid of it...<br>
        <br>
        As you may guess that brave man was me… <br>
        <br>
        There is a myth that you must find out how to crack the riddle at the Kingdom’s gates, write some 
        magical words on it – HTML they call it. That myth was true, and it was my first challenge. 
        I could have shown off and said that it was an easy task, but no, I would not! Reading old manuscripts, 
        written deep inside the Earth’s caves by monks with grizzled beards, I have found such desired answers. 
        Finally, I entered it, one of many, but alone, without companions, in full darkness, lonely soul in the 
        infinite world. Hearing terrible sounds in that darkness, I had again and again second thoughts to turn 
        back and run from it, simply come back home, to safety. “Do it! Go home! Leave it! It is forbidden!” 
        I have heard all the time in my head, however, I have decided not to stop and fight my nightmares…<br>
        <br>
        Despite all the dangers, fights with CSS monsters, suffer from hunger and sleepless nights… 
        "Okay stop Anton! Less drama please! Oh, you are... Bloody Mary, closer to the topic, 
        do not make your teacher to read useless information."<br>
        <br>
        "All right! All right! As you wish Your Majesty, annoying muse…"<br>
        <br>
        So, I was there Margit, I had reached it, finally, the Castle of The Source, high like the highest 
        mountain ever. Observing the Gothic style of the Place, I felt some familiar perfume, with the aroma 
        of a cold morning and violets.  “I had felt it before!” - said I to myself. “Yes, yes, exactly – Pancake!” - 
        said I again in my head. I glanced up - it was she, gorgeous, beautiful, incredible so powerful as 
        billions of black holes, the Quen of everything - JavaScript. I got down on one knee and asked her 
        to let the cat out of the bag, spill the beans, give me desire knowledge that I came for. She agreed…<br>
        <br>
        The Final Chapter<br>
        <br>
        I have forgotten about time, spending days with her, it was…it was incredible, she taught me things that 
        I had never known before. Nevertheless, in some moments I wanted to kill her, but in other moments I loved her 
        so much that there are not enough words in our world to express it. Dear Margit Tennosaar, I am still here, 
        living in her castle, side by side, maybe having lack of understanding her mindset and not following her thoughts, 
        however, seeing how she gracefully walks, how she carefully takes things and puts in in place, when she gives 
        me the game away about different techniques… I am not coming back, sorry, I cannot leave her alone…<br>
        <br>
        Kind regards,<br>
        Anton Riabokon
